# Login Page Project

A simple login / authentication web project (frontend + backend) built with HTML, JavaScript, and a Node.js server (or as appropriate). This repository demonstrates a basic login page, dashboard, and server-side handling.

## 🚀 Features

- Login form (username & password)
- Basic validation on client side (JavaScript)
- Server-side logic to authenticate user credentials
- After login, redirection to a dashboard page
- Static frontend + minimal backend to illustrate flow

---

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14.x or above)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Installation & Running

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hmPriyanka-16/login_page.git
    cd login_page
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the server:

    ```bash
    node servers.js
    ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to:

    ```
    http://localhost:3000
    ```

5. Try logging in using the credentials that your backend expects (you may have to check `servers.js`).

---

## 📋 Usage

- Submit the login form on `index.html`.
- The client sends credentials to the server endpoint (e.g. `/login`).
- The server validates credentials; on success, redirects or responds so the client shows the dashboard.
- On failed login, show error messages to the user.

---

## 📦 Dependencies

Dependencies are declared in `package.json`. Key ones might include:

- `express` or another web server framework  
- Any middleware for parsing JSON / URL‑encoded bodies  

(Use `npm list --depth=0` to view installed packages.)

---

## 🧩 Possible Enhancements / TODOs

- Hashing and salting passwords (for real security)
- Persistent user database (e.g. MongoDB, MySQL)
- Session or JWT based authentication
- Better error handling, input sanitization
- Responsive / modern UI (use frameworks like Bootstrap, Tailwind)
- Logout feature, “remember me” option, password reset

Let me know if you want me to generate a README tailored precisely to what’s in your `servers.js` or other files.
